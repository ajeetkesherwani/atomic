It is a 4P circuit breaker with 4 protected poles and 40A In rated current and D tripping curve. The rated short circuit breaking capacity goes up to 10000 A at 415VAC conforming to EN/IEC 60898-1 standard and 10000A at 415VAC conforming to EN/IEC 60898-1 standard. It complies with both industrial standard EN/IEC 60898-1 and residential standard EN/IEC 60947-2. This miniature circuit breaker protects circuit against short circuit and overload current. The presence of the green strip guarantees physical opening of the contacts. It allows operations to be performed on the downstream circuit in complete safety. Mechanical durability goes up to 20000 cycles and electrical durability goes up to 10000 cycles. The Ue operational voltage is going from 240VAC. The Ui rated insulation voltage is 500VAC. The Uimp rated impulse withstand voltage is 6kV. The operating frequency is 50Hz or 60Hz. It can be mounted on DIN rail for modular installation. Its width is 8 pitches of 9mm. Pollution degree is 3.
