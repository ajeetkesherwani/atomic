The data stream is converted from an electrical pulse to an optical beam, then back to an electrical pulse. Because there is no electrical connection between the DTE and DCE sides of the isolator, the ATC-131, unlike a surge suppressor, will not pass large sustained power surges through to your equipment. This isolator will protect both the transmit and receive lines at baud rates up to 57.6K without the need of an external power supply. Power is derived through the transmit and handshake lines. Special circuitry allows the ATC-131 to be powered regardless of the state of the handshake lines. At least one handshake line must be connected on each side of the isolator. Note that handshake line signals are not passed through the isolator.",1710574510-Product-Screenshot 2024-03-16 130450.png,1710574510-Product-Screenshot 2024-03-16 130455.png,,,,Interface,Conforms to EIA RS-232C standards,Communication,Asynchronous full duplex,Connector(s),"RS232: DB9 female, RS232: DB9 male",Dimensions,63mm x 33mm x 17mm,Enclosure,Plastic shell,Humidity,5% to 95%,Interface(s),Interface feature: Conform to EIA RS - 232 and CCITT v. 24 asynchronous protocol/ Electric: Use the DB9 connector on both sides,Isolation,2500V in succession or 7500V pulse,Power Supply,"To the RS-232 port (TXD, RTS or DTR)",Temperature Range,-20ºC to 70ºC (-4ºF to 158ºF),Transmission Speed,0-57.6kbps,1710574510-Product-Screenshot 2024-03-16 130443.png,,,18%,,,,,,,,,1,1-2 Days
